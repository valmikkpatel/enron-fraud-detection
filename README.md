##Identifying Fraud from Enron Email Data
for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd002), Project 4

###Introduction

Enron scandal has been one of the biggest financial scandal in history. It went bankrupt from a maximum valuation of $70 billion due to wisespread internal fraud and corruption. Due to resulting investigation and legal proceedings a significant amount of confidential information entered public domain.

Utilizing `scikit-learn` and machine learning methodologies, I built a "person of interest" (POI) identifier to predict guilty employees, using features from financial data and email data.
